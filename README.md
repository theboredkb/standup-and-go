# Bot Template for DiscordGo

## A simple bot template to use for discord bots
I spent some time trying to figure out DiscordGo so I made a template for future use. I made it for my own personal use but anyone is free to use it. Included is an example of how I setup a simple ping command that replies with a "pong". This can be easily extended to add other commands as needed.

### Files to look into for adding commands:
./internal/command/command.go
./config/commands.json
